# Overview
This is to provide the ability to run a containerized instance of handbrake to transcode the original video file to one that will minimize CPU load when streaming.

# Current State
The container will boot into bash with handbrake-cli installed. This will be changed later to automatically run handbrake on the input file and output the transcoded file.
